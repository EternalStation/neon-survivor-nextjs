# Meteorite Rarity Levels - Visual Guide & Prompts

This document serves as a reference for the visual style and prompts used to generate the meteorite-like crystals for the arcade game. All images follow a **retro pixel art style** (128x128) with sharp pixels, irregular jagged shapes, and transparent backgrounds. All energy/glow is strictly contained within the silhouette.

## 1. Scrap
- **Status**: ✅ Generated (`scrap.png`)
- **Visual**: Dull gray-brown rock shell with cracks. Thick rock dominates. Very faint trapped cyan energy barely visible through small cracks. Faint cyan rim glow on edges only.
- **Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Scrap' rarity. Irregular jagged shape, thick dull gray-brown rock shell with cracks. Very faint trapped cyan energy barely visible deep inside cracks (subtle hints only). Faint cyan rim glow on edges only. STRICTLY no outer effects, no sparks, no particles outside silhouette. Retro style, sharp pixels, transparent background. Centered for hexagon socket.`

## 2. Anomalous
- **Status**: ✅ Generated (`anomalous.png`)
- **Visual**: Dull gray-teal rock shell with cracks. Unstable faint teal energy core flickering visibly through cracks (more energy than Scrap). Low-intensity faint teal rim glow on edges only.
- **Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Anomalous' rarity. Irregular jagged shape, dull gray-teal rock shell with cracks. Unstable faint teal energy core flickering visibly through cracks (more energy than Scrap). Low-intensity faint teal rim glow on edges only. STRICTLY no outer effects, no sparks, no particles outside silhouette. Retro style, sharp pixels, transparent background. Centered. Label 'Anomalous' in small pixel text at the bottom.`

## 3. Quantum
- **Status**: ✅ Generated (`quantum.png`)
- **Visual**: Dark gray-cyan rock shell with cracks. Electric cyan energy core pulsing visibly through cracks (more energy than Anomalous). Moderate-intensity electric cyan rim glow on edges only.
- **Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Quantum' rarity. Irregular jagged shape, dark gray-cyan rock shell with cracks. Electric cyan energy core pulsing visibly through cracks (more energy than Anomalous). Moderate-intensity electric cyan rim glow on edges only. STRICTLY no outer effects, no sparks, no particles outside silhouette. Retro style, sharp pixels, transparent background. Centered. Label 'Quantum' in small pixel text at the bottom.`

## 4. Astral
- **Status**: ✅ Generated (`astral.png`)
- **Visual**: Dark gray-purple rock shell with cracks. Deep purple cosmic energy visible through cracks with star-like specks and faint nebula patterns inside. Stronger violet neon rim glow on edges only.
- **Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Astral' rarity. Irregular jagged shape, dark gray-purple rock shell with cracks. Deep purple cosmic energy visible through cracks with star-like specks and faint nebula patterns inside. Stronger violet neon rim glow on edges only. STRICTLY no outer effects, no sparks, no particles outside silhouette. Retro style, sharp pixels, transparent background. Centered. Label 'Astral' in small pixel text at the bottom.`

## 5. Radiant
- **Status**: ✅ Generated (`radiant.png`)
- **Visual**: Irregular jagged rock shell in dull gray-gold. Intense golden-white radiant energy core pulsing strongly and VISIBLY TRAPPED inside, bursting against the rock shell from within. Larger cracks and craters revealing MORE of the bright inner light.
- **Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Radiant' rarity. irregular jagged rock shell in dull gray-gold. Intense golden-white radiant energy core pulsing strongly and VISIBLY TRAPPED inside, bursting against the rock shell from within. Larger cracks and craters revealing MORE of the bright inner light. Energy feels pressurized and contained but ready to burst. Intense yellow-gold neon rim glow on edges only. STRICTLY no outer effects, no sparks, no particles outside silhouette. Retro style, sharp pixels, transparent background. Centered. Label 'Radiant' in small pixel text at the bottom.`

## 6. Abyss
- **Status**: ⏳ Pending
- **Visual**: Dangerous dark red core with angry red rim, chaotic fire-like particles trapped inside. Very thin rock shell in dark gray-red.
- **Planned Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Abyss' rarity. Irregular jagged shape, very thin dark gray-red rock shell. Dangerous dark red energy core angrily glowing and visible through deep cracks (chaotic fire-like patterns trapped within). Intense crimson-red neon rim glow on edges only. STRICTLY no outer effects, no sparks, no particles outside silhouette. Retro style, sharp pixels, transparent background. Centered. Label 'Abyss' in small pixel text at the bottom.`

## 7. Eternal
- **Status**: ⏳ Pending
- **Visual**: Ancient polished gold with metallic sheen, intricate golden energy veins. Rock shell should feel metallic but still like an irregular asteroid.
- **Planned Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Eternal' rarity. Irregular jagged shape, ancient polished gold rock shell with metallic sheen. Intricate golden energy veins pulsing through surface cracks. Intense golden neon rim glow. STRICTLY no outer effects, no sparks, no particles outside silhouette. Retro style, sharp pixels, transparent background. Centered. Label 'Eternal' in small pixel text at the bottom.`

## 8. Divine
- **Status**: ⏳ Pending
- **Visual**: Pure white crystal-infused rock with soft ice-blue halo, rainbow diffraction edges visible through shell.
- **Planned Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Divine' rarity. Irregular jagged shape, pearlescent white rock shell with soft ice-blue halo. Rainbow diffraction edges visible through deep crystalline cracks. Holy light beams trapped inside. Intense ice-blue neon rim glow. STRICTLY no outer effects, no sparks, no particles outside silhouette. Retro style, sharp pixels, transparent background. Centered. Label 'Divine' in small pixel text at the bottom.`

## 9. Singularity
- **Status**: ⏳ Pending
- **Visual**: Near-black void center with crushing indigo-violet accretion disk effect trapped inside shell. Swirling black hole particles.
- **Planned Prompt**: `128x128 pixel art of a cosmic meteorite rock, 'Singularity' rarity. Irregular jagged shape, black obsidian-like rock shell. Crushing indigo-violet accretion disk effect visible through central voids. Swirling black hole particles trapped inside. Extreme indigo-violet neon rim glow. Most epic and powerful.
